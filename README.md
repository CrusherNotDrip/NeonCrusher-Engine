## About the Engine
uhh crusher engine iss uhhh e uhhhh ermmm uhh I forgor 💀 (mainly cuz nothing cool is inside the engine except for judgement counters but thats very fucking ez to make)

## Stuff that fnf didn't add that I added into this engine

- Daddy Dearest Losing Icon (ok lets be real ANYONE can make this)
- Healthbar Colours (it was kinda ez to make and I didnt have to steal code from psych!)
- Combo Sprite (WIP)
- Options (WIP and I suck at making this also fnf did add this but its in the newgrounds version)
- Ghost Tapping (uhh for now you can spam the shit out of your keys and not get any misses (cuz theres no anti spam), I do plan on fixing it though!)
- Judgement Counters (Basically if you notes it tells you how much notes you hit, your combo, your sicks, goods, bads etc.)

and thats really it
